He is also the giver of different types of favors. The Hindu tradition calls Ganesha as the Vighneshvara.

<br><h2>Lord Subramanya (Second Child)</h2>
<p><b>Kartikeya also known as Skanda, Kumara, Murugan and Subrahmanya, is the Hindu god of war. He is the son of Parvati and Shiva, brother of Ganesha, and a god whose life story has many versions in Hinduism. An important deity in the Indian subcontinent since ancient times, Kartikeya is particularly popular and predominantly worshipped in South India, Sri Lanka and Malaysia as Murugan.
Kartikeya is an ancient god, traceable to the Vedic era. Archaeological evidence from 1st-century CE and earlier, where he is found with Hindu god Agni (fire), suggest that he was a significant deity in early Hinduism. He is found in many medieval temples all over India, such as at the Ellora Caves and Elephanta Caves.</b></p>
