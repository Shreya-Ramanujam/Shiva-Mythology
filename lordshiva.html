<p><b>Shiva is the third god in the Hindu triumvirate. The triumvirate consists of three gods who are responsible for the creation, upkeep and destruction of the world. ... <br>
     Shiva is known to have untamed passion, which leads him to extremes in behaviour. 
    Sometimes he is an ascetic, abstaining from all wordly pleasures.
    Hindus believe his powers of destruction and recreation are used even now to destroy the illusions and imperfections of this world, paving the way for beneficial change. According to Hindu belief, this destruction is not arbitrary, but constructive. Shiva is therefore seen as the source of both good and evil and is regarded as the one who combines many contradictory elements.
      At others he is a hedonist.</b></p>
     <br><h2>How does Shiva look like?</h2>
     <p><b>In his representations as a man, Shiva always has a blue face and throat. 
    Strictly speaking his body is blue. </b></p><br>
    <li class="b"><b>A third eye</b></li>
     <li><b>The extra eye represents the wisdom and insight that Shiva has. It is also believed to be the source of his untamed energy. It gets open when the lord get anger.
     <br> On one occasion, when Shiva was distracted in the midst of worship by the love god, Kama, Shiva opened his third eye in anger. 
     <br> Kama was consumed by the fire that poured forth, and only returned to life when Parvati intervened.</b>
     </li> <br>
     <li class="b"><b>A cobra necklace</b></li>
     <li><b>This signifies Shiva's power over the most dangerous creatures in the world. <br> Some traditions also say that the snake represents Shiva's power of destruction and recreation. 
       <br>   The snake sheds its skin to make way for new, smooth skin.</b></li>
       <br>
       <li class="b"><b>The vibhuti</b></li>
       <li><b>The vibhuti are three lines drawn horizontally across the forehead in white ash. <br>
           They represent Shiva's all-pervading nature, his superhuman power and wealth. Also, they cover up his powerful third eye. Members of Shaivism often draw vibhuti lines across their forehead.</b></li>
      <br><li class="b"><b>The trident</b></li>
      <li><b>The three-pronged trident represents the three functions of the Hindu triumvirate.</b></li>
